## Parallel Execution Status

Intra-pipeline parallelism: each pipeline can be executed by N PipelineTasks
running concurrently, dispatched per-extent from the source's GlobalSourceState
and combined into a shared GlobalSinkState before Finalize. Thread count is
controlled by `PRAGMA threads = N` (default = `hardware_concurrency`).

### Parallel-safe operators

| Operator role | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **NodeScan** (source) | ✅ | Per-extent dispatch, multi-oid support, in-memory delta extents handled via `NodeScanGlobalState::TryClaimDeltaPhase()` (one thread claims) |
| NodeScan **with filter pushdown** | ✅ | Enabled. Required four fixes: output mapping + FP_COMPLEX init (`a151b565a`), `ChunkCacheManager::PinSegment` race serialization, parallel `MergeUserIdPropertyUpdates` overlay, `PipelineTask` using operator's `InitializeOutputChunks` for empty-type chunks |
| HashAggregate (sink + Combine) | ✅ | |
| HashJoin (sink) | ✅ | Build side parallel; per-thread local HT → Combine into global |
| HashJoin (probe / mid-pipe) | ✅ | `deps` map allowed when every dep op is `HASH_JOIN`. Other dep types still gated |
| Sort (sink) | ✅ | |
| TopNSort (sink) | ✅ | |
| ProduceResults (sink) | ✅ | |
| BlockwiseNLJoin (sink) | ✅ | |
| CrossProduct (sink) | ✅ | |
| Filter / Projection / Unwind / Top | ✅ | Stateless (per-thread checkpoint) |
| **IdSeek** (mid-pipe) | ✅ | Filter-pushdown scratch (`tmp_chunks`, `executors`, `is_tmp_chunk_initialized_per_schema`) moved to per-thread `IdSeekState` |
| **AdjIdxJoin** (mid-pipe) | ✅ | All state per-thread in `AdjIdxJoinState` |
| **VarlenAdjIdxJoin** (VLE, mid-pipe) | ✅ | All state per-thread in `VarlenAdjIdxJoinState` |
| Multi-group / multi-source pipelines | ✅ | `ExecutePipelineParallel` loops over `pipeline->AdvanceGroup()` to scan e.g. `Place = City + Country` variants |
| PipelineTask HMO drain | ✅ | Stack-based, mirrors sequential `ExecutePipe` (commit `01b610d74`) |
| `graph_storage_wrapper` mutable state | ✅ | Refactored into caller-owned `IndexSeekScratch` |
| PiecewiseMergeJoin (sink) | ❌ | Not parallel — complex two-side merge, low ROI |

### Gates remaining in `CanParallelize()`

The following pipeline shapes are **silently sequential** today:

| Gate | Means | Why it matters | Path to unblock |
|---|---|---|---|
| `!childs.empty()` | Pipelines whose **source** is a previous pipeline's sink (HashAgg result, Sort result, HashJoin output) | Final-projection pipeline, post-aggregation passes | Need parallel source operators that read from a finalized GlobalSinkState — HashAggregate-as-source is the most impactful |
| `dep.type != HASH_JOIN` | Pipelines where a mid-op references e.g. a CrossProduct/BlockwiseNLJoin sink | Rare in TPC-H/LDBC but blocks any future query that puts those sinks mid-pipeline | Verify those operators' Execute is thread-safe given a finalized shared sink state, then add to the allowlist |
| Operator type not in allowlist | Any unknown mid-pipe op | Future operators | Audit + add case |

### Open follow-ups (priority order)

#### 1. Parallel sources from previous-pipeline sinks  *(MEDIUM impact)*

Drop the `!childs.empty()` gate by giving HashAggregate / Sort / HashJoin a
parallel-scan-from-finalized-state path. HashAgg-as-source is the most
common case (final projection pipeline reading agg result).

#### 2. Other dep-op types  *(LOW impact)*

Audit `BlockwiseNLJoin` / `CrossProduct` / etc. as mid-pipe operators with
`deps`, verify their Execute paths are read-only against a finalized shared
sink state, and add to the `CanParallelize()` allowlist.

#### 3. Pipeline-level parallelism  *(LOW priority)*

We do intra-pipeline only. Independent pipelines could run concurrently. Most
TPC-H/LDBC queries have linear pipeline DAGs so the win is bounded.

### Parallel work — commit log

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `01b610d74` | `PipelineTask::ProcessChunk` HMO drain — stack-based, mirrors sequential `ExecutePipe` |
| `f23e0398b` | Enable AdjIdxJoin in CanParallelize + multi-group / delta gating (gates later removed) |
| `fa5d34051` | `ExecutePipelineParallel` multi-group loop — runs each child variant in turn into shared sink |
| `cae3c95c4` | Enable VarlenAdjIdxJoin in CanParallelize |
| `462ec71b0` | `PhysicalIdSeek` filter-pushdown parallel-safe refactor — `tmp_chunks` / `executors` / init-flags moved to `IdSeekState` |
| `cf1cc6075` | Parallel NodeScan reads in-memory delta extents via `TryClaimDeltaPhase()` |
| `56f5fc62a` | Allow `HASH_JOIN`-deps probe pipelines in CanParallelize |
| `9abaf3674` | Doc-only — initial filter-pushdown parallel symptoms |
| `a151b565a` | Filter-pushdown parallel: `output_column_idxs` mapping fix + FP_COMPLEX init OOB fix (still gated by `ParallelSource()`) |
| (this commit) | Filter-pushdown parallel NodeScan **enabled**: `ChunkCacheManager::PinSegment` race serialized; parallel `NodeScan::GetData` calls `MergeUserIdPropertyUpdates` so post-SET reads see new values; `PipelineTask` now uses `op->InitializeOutputChunks` so empty-type IdSeek chunks are tolerated. LDBC 464/464, TPC-H 23/23 |

    → Binder (BindContext, BoundExpressions)
    → Converter (Cypher2OrcaConverter → ORCA CExpression tree)

### Converter Design Decisions

**PlanProjectionBody** (`cypher2orca_converter.cpp:~1417`):
- Detects aggregation in RETURN/WITH projections
- Splits expressions into GROUP BY keys vs aggregates
- **Pre-projects computed GROUP BY keys** (e.g., `date_part('year', col)`) via CLogicalProject before PlanGroupBy — ORCA's GbAgg requires key columns to be simple CScalarIdent
- **Pre-projects complex aggregate inputs** (e.g., `SUM(a * (1-b))`) — DuckDB hash aggregate requires aggregate children to be BOUND_REF
- **Recursively extracts nested aggregates** from expressions like `100 * SUM(...) / SUM(...)` — splits into aggregation step + post-aggregation projection
- **Inherits alias_map** in PlanGroupBy to preserve WITH aliases through aggregation stages

**PlanGroupBy** (`cypher2orca_converter.cpp:~2080`):
- `const` → non-const parameter to allow pre-projection replacement of aggregate children
- `new_schema.inheritAliases(*prev_plan->getSchema())` preserves WITH aliases
- Registers aliases for all output columns (agg results, GROUP BY keys, general expressions)

### EXISTS Subquery Implementation

**Single outer-bound node** pattern:
```
EXISTS { MATCH (n)-[:EDGE]->(m) WHERE pred }
```
- Inner plan: edge scan + target scan (outer node NOT re-scanned)
- Correlation: `outer.n._id = inner.edge._sid` via CLogicalSelect
- ORCA decorrelates to LeftSemiHashJoin (EXISTS) or LeftAntiSemiHashJoin (NOT EXISTS)
- UBIGINT↔ID binary-coercible cast enables decorrelation (edge _sid is UBIGINT, node _id is ID)

**NOT EXISTS**: `ConvertBoolOp` detects `NOT + EXISTENTIAL` pattern and generates `CScalarSubqueryNotExists` directly (instead of `NOT(CScalarSubqueryExists)`), enabling ORCA to decorrelate to `LeftAntiSemiHashJoin`.

**RHS outer-bound**: `PlanRegularMatch` now checks `rhs_is_subquery_outer` in addition to `lhs_is_subquery_outer`. When the target node of an edge is outer-bound (e.g., `(o:ORDERS)-[:MADE_BY]->(c2)` where `c2` is outer), the RHS scan is skipped and correlation key is recorded.

**Outer property references**: `ConvertExistsSubquery` registers `outer_plan_` before converting inner predicates, so `TryGenScalarIdent` can resolve outer property references (e.g., `s.S_SUPPKEY` in inner WHERE).

**Limitation**: Q21 pattern with inequality correlation (`<>`) in join predicate not yet supported in HashJoin execution. See Q21 analysis above.

### PlanGroupBy Variable Key Pruning

When a node/edge variable appears as GROUP BY key (e.g., `WITH lineitem, avg(...)`), only `_id` + downstream-referenced properties are included as GROUP BY keys, instead of all properties. This prevents:
- Bloated GROUP BY key sets (17 cols → 3 cols for LINEITEM)
- Internal types leaking to output schema (edge _sid/_tid)
- `_id` is included only when downstream actually references it (via MATCH re-binding, property access, or variable identity comparison)

**Key files**: `CollectDownstreamPropertyRefs` and `CollectPropertyRefsFromExpr` in `cypher2orca_converter.cpp`

### Regex → LIKE Optimization

Parser rewrites simple `=~` regex patterns to LIKE for ~40% performance improvement:
- `.*X.*Y.*` → `%X%Y%` (LIKE)
- Complex regex (character classes, alternation, etc.) falls through to `regexp_full_match`
- Implemented in `TryRegexToLike()` in `cypher_transformer.cpp`

### Cypher substring 0-based → DuckDB 1-based

Parser converts `substring(str, start, len)` start index from Cypher 0-based to DuckDB 1-based by adding 1 to the start argument. Handles both constant and non-constant start expressions.

### Bulkload

- **LDBC**: `scripts/load-ldbc.sh` — uses `turbolynx import`
- **TPC-H**: `scripts/load-tpch.sh` — same format
- **Multi-key vertex** (LINEITEM): composite key `(L_ORDERKEY, L_LINENUMBER)` → combined single key via `key1 * multiplier + key2` registered alongside original pair in `PopulateLidToPidMap`
- **DOUBLE/FLOAT types**: added to `graph_simdcsv_parser.hpp` type map
- **ConcatFun**: was commented out in `string_functions.cpp` → re-enabled for `||` operator support

### Data Restoration
```bash
# LDBC
rm -rf /data/ldbc/sf1 && bash /turbograph-v3/scripts/load-ldbc.sh

# TPC-H
rm -rf /data/tpch/sf1 && bash /turbograph-v3/scripts/load-tpch.sh /turbograph-v3/build-release
```

⚠️ **CRUD tests (Q7) modify LDBC data**. If Person count ≠ 9892, reload. Use release build for bulkload (debug is 12x slower).
